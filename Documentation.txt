First, we created a next.js app with npx create-next@latest app_name;
Then, we use npm run dev to run it locally and view it in our browser(chrome)
Then we initialized and set up SANITY which is out backend database (here you created an account with your github)
we create a folder called studio and cd into the studio folder 
Then we run the commad to get cleverprogrammer benefit package from sanity "sanity init --coupon cleverprogrammer"
Then login , create a project, open the studio and create your default schema
Then you can use "sanity start" to run sanity after creating your schema

then we install "yarn add @sanity/client" with yarn so we can use it to interact with sanity at the frontend
we also need to install "yarn add @sanity/image-url" this helps us to turn a logo into an image instead of just referencing it


remember

  to run this app cd to coinbase folder and run "npm run dev"
  the open a new bash terminal and cd into studio to run "sanity start"
  leave the two on and you open a third terminall for any other thing like inatalling.
